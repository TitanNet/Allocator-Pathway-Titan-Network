    "Brief history of your project and organization": "PNUTS.AI is an innovative, non-profit AI platform dedicated to eliminating global language barriers by leveraging advanced machine translation and speech recognition technologies. The platform aims to provide barrier-free communication experiences for all, breaking traditional limitations of translation services and fostering cross-cultural exchanges and collaborations. With its robust algorithms and diverse language support, PNUTS.AI's mission is to drive social progress through technological innovation, enabling everyone to easily bridge language gaps and achieve global connectivity.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data stored on Filecoin via PNUTS.AI mainly consists of multilingual text corpora, audio - speech datasets, and model training intermediate data. The text corpora are used for fine - tuning machine translation models to accurately convert between different languages. The audio datasets support the improvement of speech recognition systems, enabling more precise real - time language conversion. The intermediate data is crucial for optimizing our AI algorithms, enhancing the overall performance of our language - barrier - breaking solutions.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "**Data Preparation and Technical Solution**\n\n1. **Data Processing**\n    • Encrypt sensitive data using `fscrypt` and verify the integrity of backups with `rsync`.\n    • Shard and deduplicate multilingual data, and generate SHA - 256 checksums.\n\n2. **CAR File Packaging**\n    • Generate CAR files through Singularity.\n\n3. **Storage and Transmission**\n    • Currently: Local RAID 10 + ZFS backup.\n    • In the future: Network transmission (rsync/SFTP) + Physical hard - drive mailing (encrypted + checksum files).\n\n4. **Security Measures**\n    • Encrypt metadata with OpenPGP and manage keys using HSM.\n    • Monitor the integrity of transmission with Prometheus.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "pnuts@zfsdata~# sudo du -sh /data/pnuts/*|tail -n30\n415M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4291.mp4\n310M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4292.mp4\n252M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4293.mp4\n366M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4294.mp4\n140M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4295.mp4\n422M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4296.mp4\n505M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4297.mp4\n225M    /data/pnuts/cctube_4298.mp4\n472M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO80.mp4\n229M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO81mp4\n538M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO82.mp4\n517M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO83.mp4\n128M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO84.mp4\n227M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO85.mp4\n328M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO86.mp4\n224M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO87.mp4\n325M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO88.mp4\n432M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO89.mp4\n340M    /data/pnuts/JIMMOO_8.mp4\n412M    /data/pnuts/cctube_01.parquet\n1.2G    /data/pnuts/cctube_02.parquet\n2.1G    /data/pnuts/cctube_03.parquet\n2.5G    /data/pnuts/cctube_04.parquet\n10G     /data/pnuts/cctube_05.parquet\n2.2G    /data/pnuts/cctube_06.parquet\n3.6G    /data/pnuts/cctube_07.parquet\n1.8G    /data/pnuts/cctube_08.parquet\n2.3G    /data/pnuts/cctube_09.parquet\n23M     /data/pnuts/cctube_10.parquet\n237M    /data/pnuts/cctube_11.parquet\npnuts@zfsdata:~#  sudo du -sh /data/pnuts\n2.13T   /data/pnuts",
